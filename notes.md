* [Accurately Measuring Model Prediction Error](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/MeasuringError.html)
  * R^2 could lead to a case of poorly measuring error
  * adjusted R^2 generally **under-penalizes** complexity

  * Bagging takes independent/parallel approach, but Boosting takes a sequential approach.
